# PrusaConnect_Camera

For Web cameras in the PrusaConnect is launched a WEB page on the Android/IOS/laptop device, which then sending photos from the camera to the prusaconnect backend.

This script uses the same WEB interface for sending picture from RPI. For the correct functionality of the camera, it is necessary to obtain a fingerprint and token ID. These variables are only known after creating the WEB camera in the prusaConnect WEB interface. The script uses RPI CSI camera for photo source. So, we need enable CSI camera and connect CSI camera to RPI
